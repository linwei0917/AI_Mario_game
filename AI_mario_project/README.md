# AI Mario game - Mario learns to play a game

## Introduction
This is a project that I made for teaching Mario to play a game.<br>
Mario should get more coins as he can and dodge the traps on the ground.<br>
I use python,pygame,pytorch,and Deep-Q-Learning for this project.<br>

Please have fun watching Mario goes on his adventure.<br>

## How to use it ?
1. run `game_human.py` to play by yourself
2. `game.py` is for AI Mario
2. run `agent.py` to train model, and watch Mario play games by himself.
